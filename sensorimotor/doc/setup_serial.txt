SETUP SERIAL
------------

For setting up your usb serial device to best work with sensorimotors
you have to enable low latency for the device(s).

Low latency mode is needed to have the best performance on higher baudrates and with multiple motors attached to the bus.  
In order to temporarily set your interface to low-latency mode type:


  setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 low_latency

when e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 is your device. If setserial is not installed on your linux machine type 

  sudo apt install setserial
 
If that works out as expected you can make this permanent when creating a udev rule file, e.g

  sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-ttyusb.rules 

and put in

  KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", MODE="0666", RUN+="/bin/setserial /dev/%k low_latency"
  KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", MODE="0666", RUN+="/bin/setserial /dev/%k low_latency"

The udev rules get activated when your reconnect your USB-to-serial device.
